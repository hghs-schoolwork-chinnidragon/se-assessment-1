ROYGBIV is a way to remember the colours of the rainbow.
Each letter stands for a colour:
    R is for Red (like an apple)
    O is for Orange (like a pumpkin)
    Y is for Yellow (like a lemon)
    G is for Green (like grass)
    B is for Blue (like the ocean)
    I is for Indigo (like dark blue jeans)
    *this one is pretty tricky, just remember it like dark blue!*
    V is for Violet (like an eggplant)
    *you could say it's another word for purple!*
These are the seven colours you see in a rainbow, and they go in this order:
Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.
