ROYGBIV is a way to remember the colours of the rainbow in order. Each letter stands for a colour:
    R is for Red (like an apple)
    O is for Orange (like a pumpkin)
    Y is for Yellow (like a lemon)
    G is for Green (like grass)
    B is for Blue (like the ocean)
    I is for Indigo, another word for dark blue (like dark blue jeans)
    V is for Violet, another word for purple (like an eggplant)
These are the seven colours you see in a rainbow in order!
