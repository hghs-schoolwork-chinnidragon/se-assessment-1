Join Crimson (the red one) and Cobalt (the blue one), the Colour Crusaders, on a fun adventure through ColourLand! 
Together, you’ll discover how cool colours can be, and learn about different examples of colours in the real world, how colours mix to make new ones, and how colours can be friends on the colour wheel. 
You’ll also learn about things like Hue, Saturation, and Value, which help colours look bright or soft.
Crimson and Cobalt love cool outfits too, so you can dress them up and help them look stylish with avatar customisation!
