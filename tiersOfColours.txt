Primary colours are the three “boss” colours: red, yellow, and blue. You can’t make them by mixing other colours—they’re the ones you start with!

Secondary colours are what you get when you mix two primary colours together. It’s like magic! For example:

Red + Yellow = Orange
Yellow + Blue = Green
Blue + Red = Purple
Tertiary colours are even cooler! You make them by mixing a primary colour with a secondary colour. That’s how you get colours like yellow-green or blue-purple.

Mixing colours is like being a colour scientist. You can make a rainbow of new colours just by experimenting!
