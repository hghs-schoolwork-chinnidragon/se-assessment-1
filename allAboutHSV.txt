Hue is the name of the colour, like red, blue, or green.

Saturation is how bright or dull the colour is.
If a colour is very bright, it has lots of saturation.
If it looks more grey or faded, it has less saturation.

Value is how light or dark the colour is.
If a colour is very light, it has a high value.
If itâ€™s very dark, it has a low value.

So, hue is the colour, saturation is how strong the colour is, and value is how light or dark it is!
