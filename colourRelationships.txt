Colour relationships are about how different colours look next to each other!
By knowing different colour relationships, we can make our designs look really good and fun!

Complementary colours: These are colours that are across from each other on the colour wheel, like red and green. They make each other stand out!
Analogous colours: These are colours that sit next to each other on the colour wheel, like blue, blue-green, and green. They look nice together.
Triadic colours: These are three colours that are spaced out evenly on the colour wheel, like red, yellow, and blue. They make a bright, fun group!
Split-complementary: Pick a colour, then use the two colours next to its opposite. For example, blue, yellow-orange, and red-orange. This combo is colourful, but not too strong.
